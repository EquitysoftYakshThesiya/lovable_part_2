# 📧 Custom Email Domain Setup

## Option 1: Use Your Own Domain (Recommended for Production)

1. **Add Domain to Resend**:
   - Go to https://resend.com/domains
   - Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
   - Verify DNS records

2. **Update Function**:
   ```typescript
   from: "Your Company <noreply@yourdomain.com>",
   ```

## Option 2: Use Gmail SMTP (Alternative)

If Resend isn't working, we can switch to Gmail SMTP:

1. **Enable App Passwords** in your Gmail account
2. **Update function** to use Gmail SMTP instead of Resend
3. **More reliable** but requires Gmail account

## Option 3: Test with Different Email Services

Try sending to:
- ✅ Gmail
- ✅ Outlook
- ✅ Yahoo
- ✅ ProtonMail

Some corporate email servers block third-party services.

## Current Status
- ✅ Function is working
- ✅ Emails are being sent successfully
- ❓ Delivery depends on email provider

**Most likely issue**: Emails are going to spam folder!
